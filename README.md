# Overview

Help Binboy clean for a better tomarrow!

This is a platforming game being created as a casual group project to help friends learn pygame. The idea was to create an eduacational game for a younger audiance, so we decided to make this one about recycling.

In the game you play as Binboy, and platform through different areas like beaches and parks in order to find and collect trash. Then, when you reach the end of the level, the player is then prompted to sort the trash into bins, seperating the actual trash from the glass, plastic, and paper. The player is given a score based on how much trash they pick up and how well they sort them.

Note: The music in pygame works best as a wav file but those are two big for GitHub. To optimize your experience we highly suggest you convert the mp3s to wav. If you don't, you will have to change the file names being called in the music file.

# Development Environment
